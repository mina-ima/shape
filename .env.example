# .env.example
# This file documents how to provide API keys for external services.
# These keys are used at runtime and should not be hardcoded in the application.

# Unsplash API Key
# You can provide this key via an environment variable (e.g., VITE_UNSPLASH_ACCESS_KEY) 
# during the build process, or via a URL fragment (e.g., #unsplash_key=YOUR_KEY) at runtime.
# VITE_UNSPLASH_ACCESS_KEY=your_unsplash_access_key

# Pexels API Key
# Similar to Unsplash, you can provide this key via an environment variable 
# (e.g., VITE_PEXELS_API_KEY) or a URL fragment (e.g., #pexels_key=YOUR_KEY).
# VITE_PEXELS_API_KEY=your_pexels_api_key
